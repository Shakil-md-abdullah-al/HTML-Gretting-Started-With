# HTML-Getting-Started-With
This Repository is about the basic practice of HTML. Here, I have divided my lesson into folders and put the learning elements in a separate folder. This repository is only the basic practice of HTML. No project or project work is added here. The very next repository I have make web development project with HTML5, CSS3, JS, and bootstrap(with a freamwork).
